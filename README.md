Data Acquisition and data Wrangling using Pandas and NumPy library
Data Acquisition & Wrangling

Data Acquisition & Wrangling: This involves obtaining raw data from various sources and then cleaning, restructuring, and preparing it for analysis. It
encompasses tasks like handling missing values, dropping irrelevant data, and merging datasets.
Data isnull: The isnull() function identifies missing values in a dataset, returning a boolean mask indicating whether each value is null
Missing Values: Identifying and handling missing values is crucial for data analysis. Techniques include imputation (filling missing values with estimated ones) or removing rows/columns with missing values.
Data Drop: Dropping data refers to removing rows or columns from a dataset, often to eliminate irrelevant or redundant information.
Data Unique: Finding unique values in a dataset helps identify distinct categories or entities within the data.
Data Types (Data Dtypes): Understanding the data types of variables in a dataset is essential for proper data manipulation and analysis.
Data Merge: Merging datasets involves combining multiple datasets into one based on common attributes or keys.

Data Describe: The describe() function provides summary statistics for numerical variables in a dataset, such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.
Data Outlier: Outliers are data points that significantly differ from other observations. Identifying and handling outliers is crucial to prevent them from skewing analysis results.
Data Fill: Filling missing values in a dataset involves replacing them with specific values, such as the mean, median, or mode of the respective column.
Data Astype: The astype() method is used to convert the data type of one or more columns in a DataFrame.
Data Boxplot: A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation of the distribution of data through quartiles.
Data Mean, Mode, Median: These are measures of central tendency used to describe the central position of a set of data values
